    <h2><Strong>Steps</Strong></h2>
    <h4>Make the Choux Dough</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>
            Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 425 F. 
            Line two large rimmed baking sheets with parchment or silicone 
            baking mats. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine the butter, water, and salt in a medium saucepan over 
            medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Stir the mixture until the 
            butter melts and is incorporated into the water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the flour all at once, lower the heat to medium-low. Stir 
            vigorously and continuously with a wooden spoon until the dough 
            comes together in a ball, pulls away from the sides of the saucepan, 
            and a thin film develops on the bottom of the pan, about 1 minute. 
            Continue to stir the dough vigorously so the dough dries out a bit 
            and moisture evaporates, another 2 1/2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from heat, transfer to the bowl of a stand mixer with the 
            paddle attachment. Let cool, stirring occasionally on a low setting 
            until the dough is only slightly warm to the touch. Beat in the eggs, 
            one at a time on low speed until each one is well incorporated into 
            the batter and the dough looks smooth before adding the next egg.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon the choux pastry dough into a pastry bag fitted with a 5/8-
            inch star tip and pipe six 4-inch lengths onto each baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake one sheet at a time until the eclair shells are very puffed 
            and just beginning to show slight color, 10 to 12 minutes. Reduce 
            the heat to 375 F and continue to bake until the pastries are golden 
            brown and dry-looking, 16 to 18 minutes more. The shells should 
            sound hollow when lightly tapped.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove them from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for 20 
            minutes before filling. Be sure to bring the oven back to 425 F 
            before baking the second batch
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Make the Pastry Cream</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>
            Warm the milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat until small 
            bubbles appear on the surface.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, in a medium heat-proof bowl, whisk the egg yolks and 
            coconut sugar until combined. Add the cornstarch, whisking 
            well to combine.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a thin stream, pour the hot milk into the yolk mixture while 
            continuing to whisk constantly until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return the mixture to the saucepan, scraping the bowl clean with 
            a silicone spatula. Over medium heat, cook while whisking constantly 
            until it thickens to the consistency of a thick pudding, about 3 1/2 
            minutes. It may look lumpy as the pastry cream starts to thicken, 
            but will smooth out as you continue to whisk.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the pastry cream to a large clean bowl and whisk in the 
            vanilla extract. Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the surface 
            of the pastry cream to prevent a skin from forming. Chill in the fridge
             or over an ice bath until completely cooled, 1 to 1 1/2 hours or 
             overnight.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Make the Chocolate Glaze</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>
            Place the finely chopped chocolate in a heat-proof bowl and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a small saucepan over medium-low heat, heat the heavy cream until 
            it's just beginning to boil. Remove from the heat immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour the hot cream over the chopped chocolate and let sit for 1 
            minute. Stir the mixture until the all the chocolate melts and the 
            mixture is smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Set the chocolate glaze aside at room temperature, stirring occasionally 
            until cool, 15 to 20 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Assemble the Eclairs</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Poke three small even holes in the bottom of the eclair shells with a 
            3/16-inch wide plain pastry tip or Bismark tip. Whisk the cold pastry 
            cream to lighten the texture. Fit a pastry bag with the pastry tip 
            and fill with pastry cream, being sure not to overfill the bag.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pipe the cream into each hole until it starts to seep out of the top 
            or you feel the pastry starting to get heavy (about 4 tablespoons of 
            pastry cream per shell). Alternatively, slice the pastry shell in half 
            lengthwise with a serrated knife and fill evenly with 4 tablespoons of 
            the pastry cream.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gently spread 1 tablespoon of chocolate glaze onto the éclair or 
            carefully dip the top of each filled éclair into the glaze (use this 
            method only if you filled the shells from the bottom). Chill about 
            30 minutes to set the glaze before serving.
        </li>
    </ol>
