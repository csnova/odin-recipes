    <h2><Strong>Steps</Strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Grease four 8-inch or 9-inch cake pans, 
            line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. 
            Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the cake: Whisk the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking soda, 
            baking powder, salt, and espresso powder together in a 
            large bowl. Set aside. Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with 
            a whisk attachment (or you can use a whisk) mix the oil, eggs, and 
            sour cream together on medium-high speed until combined. Add the 
            buttermilk and vanilla and mix until combined. Pour the wet 
            ingredients into the dry ingredients, add the hot water/coffee, and 
            whisk or beat on low speed until the batter is completely combined. 
            Fold in the chocolate chips, if using.
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide batter evenly between 4 pans. Bake for 19-23 minutes. Baking 
            times vary, so keep an eye on yours. The cakes are done when a 
            toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the cakes from the oven and set on a wire rack. Allow to cool 
            completely in the pan. The cakes may slightly sink in the middle as 
            they cool—that’s expected.
        </li>
        <li>
            As the cakes cool, prepare the chocolate mousse so it can chill and 
            be ready at the same time as the cake layers. You can also prepare 
            the mousse 1-2 days ahead of time. Whisk the hot water and cocoa 
            powder together. Set aside. Melt the chopped chocolate bars in a 
            double boiler or use the microwave. If using the microwave: place 
            the chopped chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl. Melt in 20 second 
            increments in the microwave, stirring after each increment until 
            completely melted and smooth. Pour hot water/cocoa mixture into 
            melted chocolate and stir until thick and smooth. Set aside. Using 
            a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip 
            the heavy cream, confectioners’ sugar, and vanilla extract together 
            on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 3-4 minutes. 
            Medium peaks are between soft/loose peaks and stiff peaks. Pour in 
            the chocolate mixture and using a spoon or rubber spatula, gently 
            fold together. Avoid over-mixing which can deflate/thin out the 
            mousse. Cover mousse and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 
            hours and up to 2 days. Makes about 4.5 cups chocolate mousse.

        <li>
            Assemble layers before preparing chocolate ganache: First, level the 
            cakes if needed: using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer 
            off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard (or 
            crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand or 
            serving plate. Using a large icing spatula, evenly cover the top with 
            about 1.5 cups chocolate mousse. Top with 2nd layer and evenly cover 
            the top with 1.5 cups chocolate mousse. Top with the third cake layer, 
            then spread another 1.5 cups mousse evenly on top. Save a large spoonful 
            of mousse for a thin crumb coat. Top with final 4th cake layer. Spread 
            any remaining mousse around the sides as a crumb coat. Run a bench 
            scraper around the cake to smooth out crumb coat. Refrigerate cake 
            for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. Prepare the ganache as you wait.

        <li>
            Chocolate Ganache: Place chopped chocolate in a medium heat-proof bowl. 
            Heat the cream in a small saucepan over medium heat until it begins 
            to gently simmer. (Do not let it come to a rapid boil– that’s too hot!) 
            Pour over chocolate, then let it sit for 2-3 minutes to gently soften 
            the chocolate. With a metal spoon or small rubber spatula, very slowly 
            stir until chocolate has melted and mixture is smooth. The finer you 
            chopped the chocolate, the quicker it will melt with the cream. If it’s 
            not melting, do not microwave it. If needed, see Troubleshooting 
            Chocolate Ganache. Once ganache mixture is smooth, let it cool for 20 
            minutes at room temperature before spreading on chilled cake.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour/spoon ganache on chilled cake. Smooth the top with an icing spatula 
            and the sides with a bench scraper. Top with optional garnish such as 
            fresh berries and/or chocolate shavings. Serve cake immediately or chill, 
            uncovered, for up to 4-6 hours before serving. Cake can be served at 
            room temperature or chilled.
