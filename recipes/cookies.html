    <img src="../images/cookies.png">
    <h2><Strong>Ingredients</Strong></h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 3/4 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>   
        <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>10 Tablespoons softened unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2/3 cup + 1/2 cup ground coconut sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg + 1 large egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>5 ounces semisweet chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><Strong>Steps</Strong></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together until 
            combined. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large bowl using a hand-held or stand mixer fitted with a paddle 
            attachment, beat the butter on high speed until completely smooth and 
            creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the coconut sugar and beat on medium high speed
            for 3 full minutes. Stop and scrape down the sides as needed. Beat 
            in the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract on high speed. Scrape down 
            the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            On low speed, slowly mix the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients 
            until combined. The cookie dough will be gold in color, sticky, and 
            thick. Fold in the chopped chocolate. Cover tightly and chill in the 
            refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 3 days.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove cookie dough from the refrigerator. If the cookie dough chilled 
            longer than 3-4 hours, let it sit at room temperature for about 20 
            minutes. This makes the cookie dough easier to scoop and roll.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment 
            paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.) Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roll cookie dough into balls, about 2 Tablespoons of dough each.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake the cookies for 11-14 minutes, or until very lightly browned and 
            crisp looking on the edges. My oven has hot spots and yours may too- so 
            be sure to rotate the pan once during bake time. The baked cookies will 
            look soft in the centers when you remove them from the oven. Allow to cool 
            for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet. Transfer to cooling rack to cool completely.
             I find their flavor is even better the next day.
